It’s a pleasure to see you."},{"name":"Ms. Anderson","msg":"Welcome, Mr.Chris. It’s so great that you would like to pay us a visit, please come in."},{"name":"Chris","msg":"Thank you ma-am."},{"name":"Ms. Anderson","msg":"It is good to see you Mr.chris, Helen once told me that you have been nice to her, and she also likes you. But may I ask why you are here today?"},{"name":"Chris","msg":"Of course Ms Anderson. In fact, Helen is a very good student in her class, "},{"name":"Chris","msg":"but last week when we were having the first tennis session of this semester, she refused to participate with her classmates. "},{"name":"Chris","msg":"Although I had tried to talk with her after class, Helen was a little bit shy and she wouldn't tell me the reason. "},{"name":"Chris","msg":"I really want to help her, that’s why I came here today to talk with her and to discuss this event with you to say how we can handle this issue."},{"name":"Ms. Anderson","msg":"Oh I see, it is so nice of you Mr.Chris, I really appreciate your help.

"},{"name":"Chris","msg":"I would recommend you to try tennis with us and discover for yourself if it is boring or not. Does that sound great to you?"},{"name":"Helen","msg":"I guess you are right Mr.Chris, I will try it next time. But I don’t think playing tennis or any other sport is useful for me. I only go to school to study, right?"},{"name":"Chris","msg":"You are only half correct Helen. Trying to play a sport like tennis is another form of study, and it also has many benefits for your body and mind. "},{"name":"Chris","msg":"It will build up your strength, sharpen your reflexes and your movement. Your mind would be more agile than now too. "},{"name":"Helen","msg":"Oh, really?! I didn't know it could be so beneficial before. "},{"name":"Ms. Anderson","msg":"I am sorry to interrupt you Mr. Chris, but I am still concerned about letting Helen do sport. "},{"name":"Ms. Anderson","msg":"Speaking of Helen's behaviour, it could be part of my responsibility to blame.

But now it seems that I have over-protected her,"},{"name":"Ms. Anderson","msg":"I barely allow Helen to go outside and play with other children as I am afraid that she will be discriminated against by others.

That is the real question, what is the difference between studying physics and playing tennis in terms of having achievements?"},{"name":"","msg":"➤ In terms of achievement, the joy after being praised or respected at both events are the same."},{"name":"Chris","msg":"You are absolutely right, remember, it is not what you cannot do but what you are able to do that matters. "},{"name":"Chris","msg":"Everyone will be thinking highly of you if you are willing to try and manage to succeed in playing tennis. In others’ eyes, disability will not define you but your ability."},{"name":"Ms. Anderson","msg":"Thank you Mr.Chris, I have never thought about these things in this perspective.
